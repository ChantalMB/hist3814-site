Welcome to my digital journal! I'm your host Chantal Brousseau, and this is HIST3814O Crafting Digital History!

I'm a 4th year History major studying Computer Science as a minor at Carleton University. I have a greater interest in the digitization of history and the archive, as well as UI/UX design, all of which has lead me on the path of pursuing a master's of Library and Information Science post-undergrad.

Through using what the computer science portion of my degree has taught me, I want to find and innovate new ways in which technology can be utilized to take history beyond the realm of academia and be accessible to the greater world.
