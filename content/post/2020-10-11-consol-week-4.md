Title: "Digging Deeper (Pun Intended)"
- "In studying a cemetery you might also want to investigate whether any burials physically overlap other burials, implying they took place at two different times. If you're thinking about family groups, you might want to check whether adults and infants and men and women are buried near one another."
- Only uploaded 10 graves bc no internet
- Interesting how we've built a world around (and sometimes over) cemeteries of the past
- How do we choose to craft sites of the past? We do CHOOSE, we of the present hold power over that

- But- in the interests of making a visually appealing site, only the ‘best’ models were posted. Maybe there’s something about how the process of making 3d models from photographs only really works with the fanciest, most expensive monuments (ie, there’s enough visual differentiation that the algorithms can do a good job stitching things together), meaning all the models of the poorer people were discarded or just didn’t work... what I’m getting at: how do the techs we use intersect with power and unspoken assumptions?

- Making a bad 3d model is easy, making a good one takes time, energy, and resources…. When money is involved, there’s always an exercise of power… What power do you have, as a researcher?

- Does the potential of accessible information being skewed ever cause you concern?

- Not everyone agrees with my characterization of what digital archaeology is, which the Cook & Compton article explores. How does that intersect with your thoughts?
