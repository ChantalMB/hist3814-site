This week, my failures really seemed to have taken the shape of what was comtemplated in our readings. 

I am willing to bet that the idea of ‘replication’ has never cropped up in any of your other history or GRS classes --> I want you to reflect on the readings and your work this week in the context of those other classes.

- D'Ignazio & Klein
  - Is "big dick data" a product of the "need to be right" sort of attitude that has historically been fostered in academia --> need to outshine peers to "make it to the top"/prove intelligence
  - "People who, like Simpson, are insiders to the field of Natural Language Processing event detection and/or the GDELT community, may know to not believe 1) the hype, 2) the title of the database, and 3) the documentation, but how would outsiders or newcomers ever know that?"
  - "All knowledge is "situated."" --> this could relate to the tutorial mishap ie in another form, knowledge is situated in the setting we were taught in, how would one's experience with R be
- Marwick et al.
  - Scholarship will be strengthened if we are more open with research materials, yet we lack conventions and technical infrastructure for such openness.

What might all of this imply for you as history or humanities students? Discuss this in the context of your wins/fails for this week.
- Fails
  - Trying to run the intro to R for Archaeological Data Analysis locally outside of notebook led to a lot of breaking
    - I didn't necesarily need another tutorial in R --> how would it go if I, some with basic knowledge, decided to try some of this beyond as a tutorial?
    - I feel like there might be an expectation of things to be able to "just work"
    - Used the tutorial as a guide
  - Trying to find and use data in ADS
