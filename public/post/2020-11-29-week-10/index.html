<p>Discuss the work you’ve done so far in this class as a whole and what it might mean for the communities which your graveyards serve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an archaeologist; in fact, during the entirety of my history degree, this class is the first I&rsquo;ve taken that has even had &ldquo;archaeology&rdquo; in the title. So, maybe the fact that I&rsquo;m not an archaeologist and that I haven&rsquo;t been trained in the processual traditions that still hold their place in the field are the reasons why I find the concept of NOT doing archaeology &ldquo;from the heart&rdquo; so unfathomable. This week&rsquo;s article by <a href="https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/hodgetts-kelvin.pdf">Hodgetts and Kelvin</a> discussing the heart-centred approach they learned through their work with the Inuvialuit community of Sachs Harbour was perhaps one of the most eye-opening works I&rsquo;ve read this semester, because it connected concepts that we&rsquo;ve been learning about in this course regarding the historical practice of archaeology, how this continues to influence modern archaelogical practices, and the implications that this has for the development of public and digital archaeology.</p>
<p>While I ultimately made the choice to study history, archaeology and its ties with historical representation played a signifigant role in shaping my interest in the humanities. Some of my fondest childhood memories are built around this, such as field trips with my class to the <a href="https://ottawa.ca/en/arts-heritage-and-events/museums-and-historic-sites/cumberland-heritage-village-museum">Cumberland Heritage Village Museum</a> where we&rsquo;d attend class in the one-room school house doing activities on slates from the 1930s, then later in the day learn to make butter in a restored butter churn. While interacting with these artefacts and being given the opportunity to use them instead of just seeing them in pictures or inside glass boxes, I recall a feeling of wonder, thinking things like &ldquo;wow, there was a kid just like me sitting at this desk all those years ago, their hands held this slate just like I am.&rdquo; These moments of wonder and feelings of connection are fundamentally what spurs my love of history and studying the past, and the purpose that studying it serves for me is that I can help create these feelings for others, using my knowledge to serve communities by connecting them with and teaching them about their pasts. Hodgetts recollection of the scientific and intellectual mindset she approached her archaeological work with&ndash; placing &ldquo;the mind&rdquo; over &ldquo;the heart&rdquo;&ndash; surprised me, because up until this reading I somehow have maintained the belief that the people who enter fields such as archaeology or history all do so for reasons similar to mine. I mean, <em>why else would you go into these fields?</em> I don&rsquo;t think there are many in it for the money or fame they&rsquo;ll gain. So if through your work you aren&rsquo;t producing results that serve to enhance the understandings and connection for past and living people within the community you studying and even beyond them, what is the purpose of it? How is it meaningful beyond just a set of data points?</p>
<p>In relation to the Hodgetts and Kelvin article, I found myself relfecting on the digital work I&rsquo;ve done this semester with archaeology, and found that my pratice was quite heart-centred, even if I didn&rsquo;t realize it then. Looking back at my earlier posts from when I was out working on site at the Pinhey&rsquo;s Point cemetery, I was constantly concerned with how my work might be received by or affecting a community I couldn&rsquo;t actually communicate with, so I focused my efforts on communicating with their living relatives. I learned the history of the cemetery and those buried in it not just from &ldquo;official&rdquo; sources such as city records and documents, but from the grave keeper and her husband whose family had been buried in that cemetery for generations and passed down family stories not recorded elsewhere. Additionally, I ended up attempting to actually help the community as a thank-you by using my connections in the heritage sector to help find them a heritage stonemason able to repair a number of the 19th century headstones that were cracking from weathering and age. Thanks to the pandemic this never worked out, but it did allow me to stay connected to the community I was working with and consider them in all of my actions, on site and off. I reconcilled my initial concerns with mortuary archaeology by doing as much as possible to respect and help the actual site of my work, while also ensuring I documented every headstone to the best of my ability, attempting to frame my work as a form of digital preservation which ensures that the memories of those buried there live on instead of simply becoming data points.</p>
<p>This sentiment was even somewhat apart of the struggles I faced when doing the Graveyard Compendium activity&ndash; aside from technology behaving strangely, of course. Before beginning my work, I thought HARD about the best possible way I could visualize the data without losing the person(s) present at each grave, and struggled with the fact that the dataset we were given didn&rsquo;t include the information from the other form we filled out, which actually had the names and information on the people associated with each headstone. Ultimately, I decided to attempt to use the data to analyze changing funerary aesthetics from the 19th to 20th century in order to avoid factors that may reference these presently unknown individuals and had&hellip; some unsuccessful results&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Really connected with &ldquo;research of the heart&rdquo; reading &ndash;&gt; can&rsquo;t fathom how archaeology can be done with just &ldquo;the mind&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>When collecting data for the graveyard project, research of the heart was exactly what I was doing even if I didn&rsquo;t know that at the time &ndash;&gt; interacting with the community associated with cemetary, learning from the people who care for it, and interacting with the memorials in a way that placed upmost importance on their personal history/emotional relevence?
<ul>
<li>I literally was talking to the graves man</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So committed this week to doing the &ldquo;best&rdquo; visualization possible because I <em>care</em> about how I represent these individuals, and if I&rsquo;m going to use this data without being able to explicitly ask them about consent to include them, you bet I&rsquo;m going to at least represent them to the best of my ability</li>
<li>Reconcilled my feelings about mortuary archaeology by doing as much as possible to respect and help the actual site of my work, while also ensuring I documented every headstone to the best of my ability, attempting to frame my work as a form of digital preservation which ensures that the memories of those buried there live on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In digital archaeology, it is important to not only consider the impact your work has on the data gathered, but also the impact it has on the community that it is built from.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approaching the Fabricius workbench activity with this mindset, I now think, what purpose does this serve? how does it contribute to the communities it was designed for?
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="https://github.com/googleartsculture/workbench">the github repository for the project</a>, it is meant to be &ldquo;the first digital tool that gives experts a fast way to decode the ancient Egyptian language (Hieroglyphs) and everyone else an easy way to learn about and even write in this ancient language.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Insert your contridicting experience</li>
<li>&ldquo;Often, the machine learning model gets it right on the first go. Sometimes you need to select the second or third prediction&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash;&gt; it didn&rsquo;t once correctly predict on first go, and only twice were one of the other predictions accurate</li>
<li>Heavily relient on technology/emphasis on machine learning and AI aspect of this tool
<ul>
<li>Frustrating to me as a user when their technology does not work as expected &ndash;&gt; no alternative, manual or otherwise, offered</li>
<li>Even after exploring the &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; activities that were available via <a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/fabricius/en">the project homepage</a> I found later, I still found that tutorial focused on showcasing/explaining the technology rather than explaining how to actually read and translate hieroglyphics
<ul>
<li>The info button explains how the tool works rather than giving additional explantion or resources</li>
<li>They only explain the actual translation/meaning of 3 out of the 9 hieroglyphs shown to you in the tutorial, but at the end of the tutorial they ask you to translate a hieroglyphic with no resources beyond your knowledge about the directional way hieroglyphics are read and the meaning of these 3 glyphs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Became more of <em>me</em> teaching myself to read hieroglyphics because the tool couldn&rsquo;t identify them as implied</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certainly could work for experts who already have knowledge of hieroglyphics and can translate them even when the computer can&rsquo;t</li>
<li>Certainly does not provide an an &ldquo;easy way to learn about and even write in this ancient language.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Is this tool available in arabic for the egyptian community who desire to learn about their own past?</li>
<li>If recreated with a community focus, Fabricius could be an amazing tool allowing aspiring egyptologists and those within the Egyptian community to connect with their past, and an even better tool for experts because by making the workbench tool more accessible to all, the AI improves through gaining more users who train it in their usage o</li>
