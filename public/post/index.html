                &ldquo;Historically, counting and classification have been used to dominate, discipline, and exclude.&ldquo;1 This week (or should I say last week?), I think I was left with more questions than answers. Maybe because I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to stew on everything I did thanks to pre-reading week assignments, but I&rsquo;d like to think that it&rsquo;s because my brain is working on trying to grasp a concept beyond my knowledge, and is waiting to learn more.

                When it comes to digital humanities, I feel like I tend to struggle with what constitutes a &ldquo;fail&rdquo; or a &ldquo;win&rdquo;. I tend to complete the technical elements of the course with ease&ndash; my background in computer science leaves me with few issues understanding new programming concepts or, at least, few errors I can&rsquo;t debug.

                &ldquo;Connectedness to our own humanity, reexivity toward our own emo-tional states, and an extension of human compassion that transcends time much as it transcends cultural divides in the present all make possible a different kind of archaeology where emotion is integral to the human experience past and present.&ldquo;1 Update: Who knew sun poisoning could take 3 whole days to recover from? Dehydration doesn&rsquo;t mess around&ndash; my brain was mush and only reformed on Wednesday, which meant that this whole week was a game of catch-up and frankly, ended up being a bit of a fail.

                When I started this class back in May, my impression of digital history was very vague. What came to mind when I thought about the subject was things like websites made for digital exhibitions, digitized archives, or maybe even open-source historical publications. I heard there was programming which piqued the computer science student within me, but I assumed it was all front-end and web design. I now know that digital history is SO much more.

                I have NEVER been good at producing original work. It&rsquo;s not that I dislike what I do, I just think of too much I want to do, all at once, and with all these ideas bouncing around in my head I stagnate, unsure of where to start. The proposed work of exploratory digital history for this week caused my internal monologue to voice some concerns, but fortunately, the &ldquo;reading&rdquo; associated with this week hushed it.

                You are presently reading a post on a website that almost didn&rsquo;t exist. This week of telling compelling stories through design started off strong for me&ndash; a focus on aesthetics for someone whose primary interest in terms of programming is web design is guaranteed to be a hit! I learned about a handful of new, interesting tools that can be used to represent data through mapping, create simple colour palettes for visualizing data, and go MUCH more familiar with Adobe Illustrator.

                I&rsquo;m convinced that before this week, I&rsquo;ve never used my laptop at full power before. Never have I heard my fans sound closer to what I would describe as a plane approaching take off than I did when I was trying to use the &ldquo;sort&rdquo; feature in AntConc. While this week&rsquo;s central focus was on seeking dialogue with the information we&rsquo;re analyzing, I found it to also be somewhat of a study in different ways the same task can be completed, and how the processes to achieve the same final result can lead to different or even greater understandings of the material they&rsquo;re working with.

                This week has been the most technical yet, but surprisingly the least difficult AND most enjoyable for me. Unsurprisngly— as someone who plans to pursue librarianship as a career— cleaning, organizing, interpreting, and presenting data in a user-friendly way is something I love doing. While the intention of the lessons were to teach the process of data cleaning and creating networks from said data, through exploring the different ways that historical data can be presented and how it can be used provided me with greater insight and thought into what exactly makes a &ldquo;good&rdquo; or necessary visualisation.

                This course was prefaced with the promise of failure. Not in the professor-wants-you-to-fail-the-class sort of way, rather, a promise that we as students will experience numerous small failures, yet we must embrace them as a learning tool to grow as digital historians. With that in mind, I&rsquo;m happy to report that I&rsquo;ve definitely experienced failure this week! Only two of the five activities related to course work went on without a hitch, and the last of them still remains incomplete (for now&hellip;).

                Let summer classes begin! What better things do I have to do when the whole world is in lockdown? As a university student studying both history and computer science, I chose to take this course as digital history— a field I&rsquo;ve only recently discovered in the past year— seems to encompass all of my interests. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in digitization and how what I&rsquo;ve learned studying computer science could be applied to my primary passion of history.
